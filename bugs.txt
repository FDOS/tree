Known Bugs
----------
Filenames output when Unicode (UTF-8) mode is enabled using DOS (not Win32)
executable may not be correct, as proper codepage to Unicode mapping is not done.

No other known bugs.


Known Quirks
------------
Ctrl-C does not work to kill tree, use Ctrl-Break instead.

Unicode filenames that can not map to current ANSI/OEM codepages
may not be displayed correctly.  This mimics Microsoft's tree implementation.
On Windows NT systems (or ones that implement the Unicode Win32 API),
use the /U option while redirecting the output to a file.  The file
should load in Unicode aware applications (such as Wordpad) and display
proper Unicode filenames, assuming a proper font is selected.
